assignment- after comitting a file and getting a version, look for how to roll back to the previous version with the updated one.
- what does git rm --cached do?

The git rm --cached <file> command is used to remove files from the staging area (index) without deleting them from the working directory. This is useful when you want to stop tracking a file that is already being tracked by Git. For example, if you accidentally add a large file or a file containing sensitive information to your repository, you can use this command to remove it from tracking without deleting the file from your local machine.



Restoring or Updating Previous Versions
git checkout <commit_hash> -- <file>: Restores a specific file to its state at the specified commit. Replace <commit_hash> with the hash of the commit you want to restore the file from, and <file> with the path to the file.

git revert <commit_hash>: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit. This is a safe way to undo changes, as it doesn't alter the existing commit history.
